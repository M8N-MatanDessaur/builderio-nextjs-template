 * This file centralizes design tokens as CSS variables to maintain
 * consistent styling across components and Builder.io content.
 * 
 * - Defines brand colors, typography, and spacing
 * - Enables theme changes from a single location
 * - Provides a bridge between code and Builder.io visual editing
