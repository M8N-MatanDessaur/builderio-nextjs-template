[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/your-username/nextjs-builder-localized-starter/ci.yml)](https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-builder-localized-starter/actions)

A minimalist, production-ready starter template for creating localized websites with Next.js 15, Builder.io, and Zustand for state management.

## üåê Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in locale routing and content management
- **Builder.io Integration**: Visual content editing with powerful CMS capabilities
- **Zustand State Management**: Simple and efficient state management for locale preferences
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Modern and efficient routing with React Server Components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code development
- **Optimized Performance**: Proper caching strategies for Builder.io content

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- Builder.io account with API key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-builder-localized-starter.git
cd nextjs-builder-localized-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Builder.io API key:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY=your_builder_api_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üåç Localization Setup

### Supported Locales

The template comes with support for the following locales:
- English (`en`)

You can add more locales in `src/utils/builderUtils.ts` by updating the `VALID_LOCALES` array.
and adding the locales to your builder.io space

### URL Structure

The localized content uses the following URL pattern:
- `/{locale}` - Homepage in a specific locale (e.g., `/en`, `/fr`)
- `/{locale}/{path}` - Content pages in a specific locale (e.g., `/en/about`, `/fr/contact`)

If no locale is specified, it defaults to English (`en`).

### Builder.io Content Models

For this template to work properly, you need to create a content model in Builder.io:

1. Go to your Builder.io dashboard
2. Navigate to Models ‚Üí Create Model
3. Name it `page`
4. Set the path to return dynamically `http://localhost:3000/${!locale || locale === "Default" ? "en" : locale}${targeting?.urlPath || ''}`;


## üß© How It Works

### 1. Locale Detection

The locale is detected from the URL path and stored in the Zustand store (`useLocaleStore.ts`). The store is initialized on the client side.

### 2. Content Fetching

Content is fetched from Builder.io based on the current locale and URL path. The `fetchBuilderContent` function in `builderUtils.ts` handles this with proper caching strategies.

### 3. Rendering

The fetched content is passed to the `RenderBuilderContent` component, which renders the Builder.io content with the specified locale.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Locales

1. Update the `VALID_LOCALES` array in `src/utils/builderUtils.ts`
2. Add the new locale to your Builder.io targeting attributes

### Custom Styling

The template uses CSS variables for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS files in the `src/app/assets` directory.

### Adding Components

Register custom components for Builder.io in the `src/builder-registry.ts` file.

### Component Structure

Components in this project follow a standardized file structure pattern for better organization and separation of concerns:

1. **`component-name.tsx`** - The main component file containing the React component logic and rendering.
   
2. **`component-name.module.css`** - CSS module file containing component-specific styles.
   
3. **`component-name.setup.ts`** - Contains TypeScript interfaces, types, and default props for the component.
   
4. **`component-name.registry.ts`** - Registers the component with Builder.io and defines how it will appear in the Builder.io editor, including customizable inputs and properties.

#### Example: ImageGallery Component

The ImageGallery component demonstrates this structure:

- **`ImageGallery.tsx`** - Contains the component implementation with image grid layout and lightbox functionality.
  
- **`ImageGallery.module.css`** - Styling for the gallery, carousel animation, and image layouts.
  
- **`ImageGallery.setup.ts`** - Defines interfaces for image items, gallery settings, styling options, and default values.
  
- **`ImageGallery.registry.ts`** - Registers the component with Builder.io and defines editable properties for marketers such as images, animation speed, overlay settings, and styling options.

When creating new components for Builder.io, follow this pattern to maintain consistency and make components easily configurable through the Builder.io interface.

## Additional comments
### Clean Routing Structure
- Effective use of Next.js 15 App Router with dynamic routes (`[[...page]]` and `[locale]`).
- URL-based locale detection with default to `'en'` for root paths.
- Clear separation between server and client components.

### Component Architecture
- Consistent and standardized file structure:
  - `component-name.tsx`: Main React component implementation.
  - `component-name.module.css`: CSS module styles.
  - `component-name.setup.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and default props.
  - `component-name.registry.ts`: Builder.io registration.
- Example components (e.g., `ImageGallery`) effectively showcase this pattern.
- Good reusability through common components (`Loading`, `NotFound`).

### State Management
- Efficient lightweight state management using Zustand.
- Clear and effective locale handling (`useLocaleStore`).
- Proper hydration management in client components.

### Builder.io Integration
- Clean and structured content fetching with `fetchBuilderContent` in `builderUtils.ts`.
- Organized Builder component registration (`builder-registry.ts`).
- Optimized caching leveraging Next.js 15 capabilities.

### Error Handling
- Consistent error handling using the `NotFound` component.
- Simplified page component logic, focusing on a clear, "positive path".

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Locale Management
- Robust locale handling implementation (`localeUtils.ts`) with explicit defaults and validation.
- Efficient URL parameter extraction through `getLocaleFromParams`.
- Improved clarity by migrating from context-based to direct prop-based approach.

#### Hydration Strategy
- Effective hydration management leveraging `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Clear loading state pattern to avoid hydration mismatches.
- Seamless transition from server-rendered to client-hydrated states.

#### Content Fetching
- Optimized content fetching from Builder.io with proper caching mechanisms.
- Clear error handling for scenarios where content is unavailable.
- Effective use of React Suspense and error boundaries.

### Areas of Excellence

#### Code Organization
- Logical and clean directory structure (`components`, `utils`, `hooks`, `store`).
- Consistent naming conventions across the entire codebase.
- Comprehensive documentation through JSDoc comments.

#### Performance Considerations
- Effective lazy loading with React Suspense.
- Properly implemented caching strategies with appropriate revalidation intervals.
- Optimized hydration to prevent client-server mismatches.

#### Developer Experience
- Clear and straightforward component structures ease application extension.
- Strong type safety with TypeScript interfaces and defined types.
- Consistent implementation patterns throughout the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Builder.io API Key Not Working
Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY`. If the key is invalid, you may encounter errors when fetching content.

### 2. Hydration Errors
If you encounter hydration errors, ensure that your components are properly wrapped with `use client` where necessary.

### 3. Unsupported Node.js Version
This template requires Node.js 18.17.0 or later. Use `nvm` to switch to the correct version:
```bash
nvm use
```
